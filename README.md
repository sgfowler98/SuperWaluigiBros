Simple SDL2.0 game with sprite tracking. Created for my CPSC6160 (2D Game Engine Dev.) class.

Hotkeys:
p - pause
t - change tracked sprite
q - quit

Some files were provided for this assignment, some were created by me.

All sprites and backgrounds were sourced from https://www.spriters-resource.com/
and are not my intellectual property. Most were edited in Adobe Photoshop to
fit the spriteSheet requirements.
